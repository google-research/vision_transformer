    <h1>LiT: Zero-Shot Transfer with Locked-image Tuning</h1>

    <p>
      This page is an interactive demo of the Google AI blog post
      <a target="_blank" href="http://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/locked-image-tuning-adding-language.html"
      >LiT: adding language understanding to image models</a>
      – please refer to that page for a detailed explanation of how a LiT model works.
      If you're interested in how this demo makes a JAX model run on device in your
      browser, check out our other blog post
      <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/08/jax-on-web-with-tensorflowjs.html"
      >JAX on the Web with TensorFlow.js</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below you can choose an image from a selection and then write free-form
      text prompts that are matched to the image. Once you hit return on your
      keyboard or press the "compute" button, a text encoder implemented in
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js/">TensorFlow.js</a>
      will compute embeddings for the provided text on your local device, and the
      similarity of these text embeddings to the image embedding will be displayed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The prompts can be used to classify an image into multiple categories, listing
      each category individually with a prompt "an image of a X". But you can also
      probe the model interactively with more detailed prompts, comparing the
      different results when small details change in the text.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please use this demo responsibly. The models will always compare the image to
      the prompts you provide, and it is therefore trivial to construct situations
      where the model picks from a bunch of bad options.
    </p>

      <b>Note:</b>
      The models available in this interactive demo are <b>not</b> those from the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07991"
      >paper</a>.
      We had to train much smaller text towers and tokenizers to avoid
      overloading your browser. Please see
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer"
      >our GitHub repository</a>
      for the models from the paper pre-trained on public datasets.
      Multilingual models coming soon.
